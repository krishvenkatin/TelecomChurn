## Introduction

Customer churn, or the loss of customers, is a significant challenge for telecommunications companies. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict churn behavior based on customer data and develop strategies for customer retention.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach with the following directory layout:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for usage.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains customer data from a telecommunications company. It includes features such as demographics, usage patterns, and service engagement metrics.

## Methods

Machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting are employed to develop predictive models for customer churn. The models are trained on the dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Analysis

The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Various visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the data and assess model performance.

## Results

The results of the analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting customer churn. The model achieves high accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-offs, making it suitable for practical applications in customer churn prediction.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project highlights the importance of leveraging machine learning techniques for customer churn prediction in the telecommunications industry. By proactively identifying at-risk customers and implementing targeted retention strategies, businesses can reduce churn rates and maintain customer loyalty.
